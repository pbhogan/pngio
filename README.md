## Information

pngio is a small, lightweight PNG library in C.

* It loads and saves your 32 bit images.
* It handles Apple's weird PNG format (load and save).
* It includes a small C++ wrapper that supports std::stream
* It is memory efficient.

## How To

pngio includes a slightly modified version of libpng. You'll also need to link zlib.

## To Do

* Windows support is not quite there, but easy to add.
